1.0 INTRODUCTION
The Experimental Sounding Rocket Association (ESRA) hosts and supports the International
Rocketry Engineering Competition (IREC), a week-long series of events which will set the
background and provide structure for the world’s largest university rocket engineering
competition. This new host event continues the IREC legacy of inspiring student design
teams from across the country and around the world.
1.1 BACKGROUND
The smoke and fire, noise, high speeds, and sleek aerodynamics of rocketry encourage
students to pursue science, technology, and mathematics-based careers. They have Rocket
Fever! and competition motivates them to extend themselves beyond the classroom to design
and build the rockets themselves. These students also learn to work as a team, solving real
world problems under the same pressures they’ll experience in their future careers.
ESRA held the first annual IREC in 2006. The competition achieved international status in
2011 when Canadian and Brazilian universities arrived. These schools have since been joined
by others from every continent except Antarctica. The competition has increased in size
every year since 2013, becoming the largest known collegiate level rocket engineering
competition in the world. Attendance in 2016 included as many as 600 participants –
including faculty, family, and friends of students from over 50 colleges and universities. The
next year marked the start of a new era with the inaugural Spaceport America Cup. Over
1,100 students and representatives from 22 industry partners participated in an academic
conference, rocket and payload engineering competitions, and non-competing demonstration
flight tests. IREC continues to grow with nearly 200 teams applying for admission to the
competition in 2023 with 121 teams and over 2,000 students from around the world making
the trip to Spaceport America in June of 2023 for the competition.
In 2025, the competition transitioned to Midland, Texas with the strategic objective of
inspiring students to elevate their engineering capabilities. This included the introduction of a
45,000-foot two-stage rocket category and a 100,000-foot waiver to push the boundaries of
altitude achievement. The 2025 IREC marked a record-breaking year, drawing over 1,200
students to the event and engaging more than 7,500 participants across team rocketry
programs, culminating in over 130 successful launches.
1.2 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
1.2.1 This document defines the minimum design, test, and evaluation criteria the event
organizers expect teams to meet before launching at the IREC. The event organizers
use these criteria to promote flight safety. Departures from the guidance this document
provides may negatively impact an offending team’s score and flight status, depending
on the degree of severity. The foundational, qualifying criteria for the IREC are
contained in the IREC Rules & Requirement document.

The electronic version is the official, approved document.
Verify this is the correct version before use.
1.2.2 This document builds upon:
1.2.2.1 Tripoli Rocketry Association (TRA) Unified Safety Code (USC)
1.2.2.2 National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Code for High Power Rocketry
(NFPA 1127). While NFPA 1127, Section 1.3.3, exempts colleges and
universities from its contents, these documents remain excellent supplemental
resources for student researchers to learn more about best practices adopted
by the amateur high-power rocketry community.
1.2.2.3 ESRA’s observations on student launch initiatives.
1.2.2.4 Feedback received from student teams.
1.2.3 If any IREC team is unclear about competition rules and/or requirements, or has a
situation not specifically addressed by the rules, they should contact ESRA by posting
a message in the “dteg-questions” channel on Discord. Teams are encouraged to ask
about both requirement interpretation and the spirit and intent of the rules and DTEG.
1.3 CONVENTION AND NOTATION
The following definitions differentiate between requirements and other statements. The
degree to which a team satisfies the spirit and intent of these statements will guide the
competition officials’ decisions on a project’s flight status and overall score at the IREC.
Shall: This is the only verb used to denote mandatory requirements. Failure to satisfy
the spirit and intent of a mandatory requirement will always affect a project’s
score and flight status.
May: This verb signifies that teams are allowed, but not required, to exercise the
associated action.
Should: This verb is used for stating non-mandatory goals. Failure to satisfy the spirit
and intent of a non-mandatory goal may affect a project’s score and flight
status, depending on design implementation and the team’s ability to provide
thorough documentary evidence of their due diligence on-demand.
Will: This verb is used for stating facts and declarations of purpose. The authors use
these statements to clarify the spirit and intent of requirements and goals.
1.4 FLIGHT STATUS
Flight status refers to the granting of permission to attempt flight, and the provisions under
which that permission remains valid. A project’s flight status may be either nominal,
provisional, or denied.
Nominal: A project assigned nominal flight status meets or exceeds the minimum
expectations of this document and reveals no obvious flight safety concerns
during flight safety review at the IREC.
Provisional: A project assigned provisional flight status generally meets the minimum
expectations of this document but reveals flight safety concerns during flight
safety review at the IREC which may be mitigated by field modification or by
adjusting launch environment constraints. Launch may occur only when the
prescribed provisions are met.
Denied: Competition officials reserve the right to deny flight status to any project which
fails to meet the minimum expectations of this document or reveals unmitigatable flight safety concerns during flight safety review at the IREC.

An effort is made throughout this document to differentiate between launch vehicle and
payload associated systems. Unless otherwise stated, requirements referring only to the
launch vehicle do not apply to payloads and vice versa.
1.6 REVISIONS
The IREC DTEG may require revision from one competition to the next, based on the
lessons learned by both host organizations and the participants.
1.6.1 Major revisions will be accomplished by complete document reissue.
1.6.2 “Real world events” may require smaller revisions to this document in the months
leading up to a competition.
1.6.3 Revisions will be reflected in updates to the document’s effective date.

Verify this is the correct version before use.
4.2.1.1 MCC will designate a specific range of frequencies (i.e., COTS frequencies)
within the 900 MHz (33 cm) band and within the 400 MHz (70 cm) band for
the exclusive use of COTS GPS trackers.
4.2.1.2 COTS GPS trackers used within the COTS frequency ranges must meet the
requirements of Section 4.1.2. Frequency “hopping” is not allowed within the
COTS frequency ranges (or on any frequency in any band).
4.2.1.3 All RF sources must be registered in the MCC Portal before the launch.
4.2.2 For 2026, teams will be assigned specific frequencies for COTS GPS transmitters as
follows:
4.2.2.1 Foreign teams from countries without reciprocal HAM license agreements
will be assigned one or more COTS tracker frequencies within the 900 MHz
(33 cm) band. Frequencies will be assigned via the MCC Portal prior to the
competition. Teams will surrender the use of these frequencies after
completing the Post Flight Data Recovery process.
4.2.2.2 US teams, and teams from countries with reciprocal HAM license
agreements, can elect to use COTS GPS trackers within the COTS GPS
tracker range of the 400 MHz (70 cm) band. Teams selecting this frequency
band will be assigned one or more COTS tracker frequencies via the MCC
Portal prior to the competition.
4.2.2.3 US teams, and teams from countries with reciprocal HAM license
agreements, can elect to use COTS GPS trackers within the COTS GPS range
of the 900 MHz (33 cm) band. Teams selecting this frequency band will be
assigned one or more COTS tracker frequencies at the time of the Final
Flight Safety Review. Note that teams will not be able to conduct their Final
Flight Safety Review, nor test their GPS equipment, until the frequency or
frequencies they need become available. Teams will surrender the use of
these frequencies after completing the Post Flight Data Recovery process.
4.2.2.4 Teams using SRAD GPS systems or other SRAD transmitters shall use
frequencies outside of the COTS tracker ranges in the 400 MHz (70 cm) and
900 MHz (33 cm) bands. These transmitters shall meet the requirements of
Section 4.1.2 with the exception of the bandwidth requirement.
4.2.2.5 Teams will not receive a frequency assignment for SRAD transmitters.
However, the Portal will automatically provide the number of conflicts
associated with any SRAD frequency (allowing teams to select a different
frequency at their option).
4.2.3 Teams with multiple independently recovered bodies can request separate frequencies
for the COTS GPS device in each body or use time slotting (the preferred option).
Multiple COTS GPS devices within a given body shall use time slotting.

4.2.4 Teams shall not power any transmitting electronics while in the pit area without first
checking with the MCC. This applies to transmitters both within and outside of the
COTS frequency ranges within each band. Procedures for obtaining permission to test
electronics will be developed prior to the competition.
4.2.5 Teams shall have the ability to quickly change frequencies on their COTS and SRAD
transmitting and receiving equipment.
4.2.6 Teams shall not transmit on a COTS frequency that is not assigned to them, or on any
frequency that is not registered and approved by MCC. Competition officials may
assess penalties for teams that violate this requirement.
4.2.7 Teams shall minimize usage of tracking transmitters during range operations to only
testing and actual flight operations. Transmitters shall be powered off when not in use.
4.2.8 Trackers that allow custom names to be assigned to the tracker shall include the Team
ID number and rocket section number as follows. Team 999’s Section 1 tracker name
would be “<T999S1>” (without the quotes). This is to aid in automatic parsing.
4.2.9 Should an SRAD tracking frequency conflict develop between teams waiting in the
queue or at the pads, it shall be the responsibility of the affected teams to resolve the
conflict:
4.2.9.1 One team changing their tracking system to a different (unused) frequency, or
4.2.9.2 One team delaying their launch to a subsequent salvo.
4.2.10 Ground support equipment for Hybrids and Liquids shall operate on the 1.2, 2.4 or
5.8GHz frequencies with no external RF amplifiers. 1.2GHz is recommended for video
feeds only (no data).
4.3 SRAD GPS TRACKING SYSTEMS
4.3.1 SRAD GPS solutions may be used, at the option of the team, subject to the following:
4.3.1.1 Transmissions must be outside of the ranges designated for COTS GPS
tracking and meet the requirements in Section 4.1.2 with the exception of the
bandwidth requirement.
4.3.1.2 Additional documentation detailing the design, fabrication, operation, and
testing of SRAD GPS tracking systems shall be included in progress reports.
4.3.2 APRS protocol via 1200 baud AFSK is recommended for SRAD GPS Tracking on the

operator to be licensed at the Technician level or higher.
4.4.3 The control operator’s call sign shall be used by the transmitter.
4.4.4 The control operator’s call sign and team number shall be registered with MCC
through the Portal.
4.4.5 Teams utilizing Amateur Radio frequencies and based outside of the US shall secure
US operating authority or use a solution transmitting at 900 MHz if a reciprocal
licensing agreement cannot be obtained or cannot be used. US operating authority is
most commonly accomplished via reciprocal licensing agreements.
4.4.6 International teams shall bring documentation in English (translated if necessary) of
their US operating authority if using frequencies outside of 900 MHz.
4.5 GPS TRACKING SOLUTION SAFETY INSPECTIONS
4.5.1 IREC personnel at the pads shall verify at least one of the following:
4.5.1.1 The teams are able to communicate with their receiving station and confirm
that COTS GPS signals are acquired and functioning properly, or
4.5.1.2 MCC is receiving COTS GPS telemetry successfully.
4.5.2 Launch operations will not be delayed because of COTS GPS inoperability. Teams
which cannot confirm a COTS GPS Tracking signal either through their team
receiver(s) or through the MCC shall not be allowed to launch.
4.5.3 The inoperability of an SRAD GPS will not be a reason to delay launch operations.
4.6 RECOVERY TEAM TRAINING AND RECOVERY GPS SYSTEM REVIEW AT TEAM
REGISTRATION
4.6.1 Prior to arrival in the host city on Monday of the week of the IREC, all members of the
recovery team shall have completed video training on utilization of the recovery
backpack systems.
4.6.2 Although training verification is done through the Portal, Teams may need to verify
completion of training during the check-in process in Midland.
4.7 MCC COORDINATION DURING RECOVERY
4.7.1 Teams shall acquire recovery information for their rocket from information sources in
the rocket tracker verification tent, the recovery tent or on the Portal.
4.7.2 Teams must have a recovery plan before deployment. Teams that do not have good
GPS information, or the location is not known, must develop range and direction
estimates in their recovery plan to avoid excessive wandering.

5.3 RAIL EXIT VELOCITY
5.3.1 Teams shall design their rockets to attain a rail departure velocity of at least 25 m/s (82
ft/s) based on the “effective” length of the rail. “Actual” rail lengths are currently 17

5.3.2 The “effective” rail length is defined as the distance (altitude) that the rocket has
traveled at the instant that the launch vehicle first becomes free to move about the
pitch, yaw, or roll axis.4
5.3.3 For tower launchers, the required rail departure velocity must be reached by the time
that the center of pressure of the rocket has cleared the tower.

5.5.3 Toxic propellants are defined as those requiring breathing apparatus, unique storage
and transport infrastructure, or extensive personal protective equipment (PPE).
Hydrogen peroxide is considered a toxic propellant.
4 As an example, if a single-stage rocket has two rail buttons located 1foot and 4 feet from the bottom of the rocket,
the effective rail length is 17 - 4 = 13 feet. The rail exit velocity is then the velocity of the rocket when the “altitude”
of the rocket has reached 13 feet.

length of the rocket.
10.2.1.2 For supersonic flights, the minimum static stability margin is 10% of the
length of the rocket.
10.2.2 For two-stage rockets, the above minimum static stability margins shall be determined
separately for the stack and for the sustainer.
10.2.3 Teams shall provide simulation results showing the static stability margin in calibers
through the flight where the simulation is performed with no wind. The initial
stability, in percent, shall be provided.
10.2.4 Regardless of the above stability results, Teams shall not design rockets with a fin span
less than 0.8 calibers, based on the largest diameter tube in the rocket (or in the stage

Introduction
● With the aim of supporting recovery reliability and overall safety, this Appendix sets
out guidelines for all safety critical wiring. This is defined as wiring associated with
recovery system deployments, any air-start rocket motors, location beacons (e.g.,
GPS), and any systems that can affect the rocket trajectory or stability.
● The wiring techniques described here are suggested for inspection and ease of field
repair. While non-critical wiring is outside the scope of this white paper the practices
described herein are recommended.
Hazard Identification
● Any electronic system that utilizes voltages 50 volts (AC or DC) or higher shall be
identified with the following warning external to the electronics enclosure;
"CAUTION: High voltage inside. Internal access by team personnel only."
● Teams shall provide the rationale, in their progress reports, for the use of voltages
exceeding 24 volts.
Wiring Guidelines
● All airborne wiring shall be stranded, insulated, 22 American Wire Gauge (AWG) or
lower numerical AWG (the lower the AWG wire gauge the larger the conductor
diameter) as appropriate (based on industry practice) to conduct expected currents.
Copper conductors are required except as noted below.
○ Copper conductors plated with either silver or tin (entire wire, not just the
ends) are desirable but not required.
○ When an off-the-shelf component includes flying leads, those leads may be
used unmodified. For example, an E-match may contain solid wire, a battery
connector may integrate 26 AWG wire, etc.
○ Stranded wire of a smaller diameter than 24 AWG may be used only when
needed by an off-the-shelf component. For example, if the terminal block on
an altimeter is sized to accept 24 AWG wires then that is the size of wire that
should be used for that portion of the circuit.
● Wire should be stripped only with a wire stripping tool of the correct gauge. Any
severed strands are cause for rejection.
● Each end of a wire should be terminated in one of the following approved methods:
○ Crimped into a crimp terminal (preferred). This includes crimp terminals on
multi-conductor connectors such as 9-pin D-sub connectors (see table below).
○ Screwed into a binding screw terminal (acceptable).
○ Wires should be terminated into a terminal block, only if a piece of off-theshelf equipment (i.e., an altimeter) has built-in terminal blocks and so there is
no other choice. Two-piece terminal blocks must be positively secured
together – friction fit is insufficient.

Verify this is the correct version before use.
o Removal of wire strands to allow a wire to fit into a smaller hole or terminal is
prohibited. Consider a smaller diameter conductor or different terminal type.
o Wires will be terminated by soldering only if a piece of off-the-shelf
equipment (e.g., an arming switch) has built-in solder terminals and so there is
no other choice. The reliability of solder joints cannot be fully established by
visual inspection alone.
o All crimp operations shall be performed with the correct tooling, using crimp
terminals sized for the appropriate wire gauge.
○ Where multiple wires are crimped into a single terminal, calculate the
effective gauge (for example, two 22 AWG are effectively 19 AWG) and use
the appropriately sized terminal.
● Terminals with insulated plastic sleeves (usually color-coded to indicate barrel size)
should be avoided because of the difficulty of inspection.
○ If a terminal is supplied with an insulated plastic sleeve it may be removed
and clear heat shrink applied instead.
○ Insulated plastic sleeves on terminals are typically not required if they are
mounted properly in barrier blocks. If insulation is needed, use clear heatshrink tubing.
● When a bare wire is held down by a binding screw terminal the wire shall make a
180-degree hook, and strands shall be visible exiting the screw head. Only one wire
shall be permitted per screw.
○ The wire bend shall be clockwise, so that it will tighten as the screw is
torqued.
● When ring or spade terminals are held down by binding screw terminals, a maximum
of two terminals are allowed per screw.
● A maximum of three wires shall be crimped into a single terminal barrel. Butt-splice
terminals are considered to have separate barrels on each end.
● If two or more wires must be joined, one of the following approved methods should
be used:
○ Crimp a ring terminal onto each wire, and then screw them into a barrier
block. Add approved barrier block jumper pieces if many wires must be
joined.
○ Screw the bare wire under a binding head screw in a barrier block. Add
approved barrier block jumper pieces if many wires must be joined.
○ Crimp the wires into an uninsulated butt-splice terminal, and then insulate
with clear heat-shrink tubing.
● Any wire-twisting splice method (including wire nuts) is explicitly forbidden.

● All wire terminations shall be inspected before flight.
○ Inspections will be visual to determine compliance with this document.
○ All terminations will be examined for exposed conductors that may have a
potential for electrical shorts.
○ All terminations will be pull tested by exerting a moderate pull on the wiring
to verify that it remains attached.
● All insulating tubing (usually heat-shrink) shall be transparent. This allows inspection
of the underlying hardware.
○ No tape, glue or RTV shall be used to insulate or bundle any element of the
wire harness.
Connector/Harness Guidelines
● Connectors shall be identified by labels and/or color coding to allow determination of
the associated system and mating parts.
● Connectors (except coaxial connectors) shall use crimp contacts unless no alternative
can be procured.
○ Coaxial connectors may be soldered.
● Mated connectors (except threaded coaxial connectors) shall utilize a positive locking
mechanism to keep the two halves mated under vibration and tension.
○ If the mated connectors do not have a positive locking mechanism built-in,
they shall utilize an external means of preventing connection separation, e.g.,
tie wraps, lacing, mechanical clamps.
○ Threaded coaxial connectors will be checked for finger tightness.
● Plastic connector latches are allowed but subject to inspection for damage and
engagement.
● Power connectors shall be polarized to prevent reversed power application.
● Good practice recommends that individual wires be bundled together to make a
harness (factory multi-conductor wiring in a common outer jacket is acceptable).
○ Safety critical harnesses shall be kept separate from payload harnessing (as
applicable).
○ Bundling may be accomplished by:
■ A light twist (for mechanical reasons only, no EMC mitigation is
intended).
■ Short (1 cm) lengths of clear heat-shrink tubing, zip-ties, or lacing every 5
cm.
■ Wire mesh sleeving, provided it allows for inspection of the wiring inside.
● The harness may be supported by plastic P-clamps, tie bases, or by tie wraps to
structure. Harness routing shall not be in contact with sharp edges, e.g., screw
threads, that may damage wiring.

Verify this is the correct version before use.
● All items that are connected by the harness (barrier blocks, sensors, batteries,
actuators, switches, etc.) should be rigidly fixed to the rocket structure so that they
cannot move.
○ Rigid fixing implies attachment with clamps using threaded fasteners or a
solid glue bond. Cable ties and/or tape are not acceptable examples of rigid
fixing.
○ All wiring should have strain relief (small amount of slack) to prevent
terminations and connections from demating.
● Batteries should be mounted and connected appropriately:
○ "Velcro" (or similar hook and loop material) and/or tie wraps shall not be used
as the sole method of mounting batteries.
○ Batteries that are subject to puncture damage should be mounted in a fashion
and location to mitigate the likelihood of such damage during a hard landing
or other high impact event.
○ 9V alkaline batteries shall be secured to prevent motion and connected using
proper snap terminals.
■ Batteries shall be mounted in a direction and manner that prevents
acceleration forces from disconnecting the battery connector.
○ Gel-cell lead acid battery connections shall be color coded (typically red for
positive, black for negative) to avoid reversed connection polarity. Insulated
"faston" terminals may be used in this application subject to visual inspection
and pull testing.
■ Gel cell batteries, because of their weight, will be inspected for rigid and
captive mounting. Tie wraps and/or Velcro hook and loop alone is not
acceptable.
○ Cylindrical batteries (AAA, AA, C, D, 18650, etc.) may be mounted into
commercial holders. Battery holders, if used, shall be rigidly secured to the
structure, and the batteries shall then be strapped (e.g., tie wrap, lacing) into
the holders.
■ Battery holders shall be mounted in a direction and manner that prevents
acceleration forces from compressing contact springs.
Circuit Board Guidelines
● All components greater than 7g shall be staked to prevent motion under acceleration.
○ The use of conformal coatings is suggested to provide a degree of staking for
all components and to avoid electrical shorts.
● All socketed components (e.g., integrated circuits) and press-fit contacts shall be
positively restrained so that they cannot come loose under vibration.
● Wire wrap, through-hole solder, and surface-mount solder are acceptable fabrication
methods.
● Solderless breadboards (also known as plug-in breadboards) shall not be used.

● Any commercial board for the high-power rocketry market should be considered to be
of sufficient quality, provided it is in an undamaged factory state.
● The connector between the motherboard and daughterboards shall not be the sole
means of support. Mechanical supports for the daughterboard are required.
● Cuts and jumpers are permitted if the jumpers are staked to prevent damage.
Recommended Sources
● Suggested components can be purchased from Digikey, Mouser, Omron, and Amazon
that will help to satisfy the wiring guidelines.
● These are recommendations only, and you are free to choose other parts and buy from
other suppliers.

APPENDIX C: FIRE CONTROL SYSTEM DESIGN GUIDELINES
Introduction
● The following Appendix is written, for hybrid and liquids teams, to illustrate safe fire
control system design best practices and philosophy to student teams participating in the
IREC. When it comes to firing (launch) systems for large amateur rockets, safety is
paramount. This is a concept that everyone agrees with, but it is apparent that few truly
appreciate what constitutes a “safe” firing system. Whether they’ve ever seen it codified
or not, most rocketeers understand the basics:
● The control console should be designed such that two deliberate actions are required to
fire the system.
● The system should include a power interrupt such that firing current cannot be sent to the
firing leads while personnel are at the pad and this interrupt should be under the control
of personnel at the pad.
● These are good design concepts and if everything is working as it should they result in a
perfectly safe firing system. But “everything is working as it should” is a dangerous
assumption to make. Control consoles bounce around in the backs of trucks during
transport. Cables get stepped on, tripped over, and run over. Switches get sand and grit
in them. In other words, components fail. As such, there is one more concept that should
be incorporated into the design of a firing system.
● The failure of any single component should not compromise the safety of the firing
system.
Proper Fire Control System Design Philosophy
● Let us examine a firing system that may at first glance appear to be simple, well
designed, and safe (Figure 1). If everything is functioning as designed, this is a perfectly
safe firing system, but let’s examine the system for compliance with proper safe design
practices.
● The control console should be designed such that two deliberate actions are required to
launch the rocket. Check! There are actually three deliberate actions required at the
control console: (1) insert the key, (2) turn the key to arm the system, (3) press the fire
button.
● The system should include a power interrupt such that ignition current cannot be sent to
the firing leads while personnel are at the pad and this interrupt should be under control
of personnel at the pad. Check and check! The Firing relay effectively isolates the
electric match from the firing power supply (battery) and as the operator at the pad
should have the key in his pocket, there is no way that a person at the control console can
accidentally fire the rocket.

Verify this is the correct version before use.
● But all of this assumes that everything in the firing system is working as it should. Are
there any single component failures that can cause a compromise in the safety of this
system? Yes. In a system that only has five components beyond the firing lines and ematch, three of those components can fail with potentially lethal results.
Figure 1: A simple high current fire control system.
Firing Relay
● If the firing relay was stuck in the ON position: The rocket would fire the moment it was
hooked to the firing lines.
● This is a serious safety failure with potentially lethal consequences as the rocket would be
igniting with pad personnel in immediate proximity.
Arming Switch
● If the arm key switch failed in the ON position simply pushing the fire button would
result in a fired rocket whether intentional or not. This is particularly concerning as the
launch key – intended as a safety measure controlled by pad personnel – becomes utterly
meaningless.
● Assuming all procedures were followed, the launch would go off without a hitch.
Regardless, this is a safety failure as only one action (pressing the fire button) would be
required at the control console to launch the rocket. Such a button press could easily
happen by accident.
● If personnel at the pad were near the rocket at the time we are again dealing with a
potentially lethal outcome
CAT5 Cable
● If the CAT5 cable was damaged and had a short in it the firing relay would be closed and
the rocket would fire the moment it was hooked to the firing lines. This too is a
potentially lethal safety failure.

Notice that all three of these failures could result in the rocket being fired while there are still
personnel in immediate proximity to the rocket. A properly designed firing system does not
allow single component failures to have such drastic consequences. Fortunately, the system can
be fixed with relative ease.
Consider the revised system (Figure 2). It has four additional features built into it: (1) A
separate battery to power the relay (as opposed to relying on the primary battery at the pad), (2) a
flip cover over the fire button, (3) a lamp/buzzer in parallel with the firing leads (to provide a
visual/auditory warning in the event that voltage is present at the firing lines), and (4) a switch to
short the firing leads during hookup (pad personnel should turn the shunt switch ON anytime
they approach the rocket).
Figure 2: An improved high current fire control system.
In theory, these simple modifications to the previous firing circuit have addressed all identified
single point failures in the system. The system has 8 components excluding the firing lines and
e-match (part of the rocket itself). Can the failure of any of these components cause an
inadvertent firing? That is the question. Let us examine the consequences of the failure of each
of these components.
Fire Button
● If the fire button fails in the ON position, there are still two deliberate actions at the
control console required to fire the rocket. (1) The key must be inserted into the arming
switch, and (2) the key must be rotated.
● The firing will be a bit of a surprise, but it will not result in a safety failure as all
personnel should have been cleared by the time possession of the key is transferred to the
Firing Officer.

Verify this is the correct version before use.
Arm Switch
● If the arm switch were to fail in the ON position, there are still two deliberate actions at
the control console required to fire the rocket. (1) The cover over the fire button would
have to be removed, and (2) the fire button would have to be pushed.
● This is not an ideal situation as the system would appear to function flawlessly even
though it is malfunctioning and the key in the possession of personnel at the launch pad
adds nothing to the safety of the overall system.
● It is for this reason that the shunting switch should be used. Use of the shunting switch
means that any firing current would be dumped through the shunting switch rather than
the e-match until the pad personnel are clear of the rocket.
● Thus, personnel at the pad retain a measure of control even in the presence of a
malfunctioning arming switch and grossly negligent use of the control console.
Batteries
● If either battery (control console or pad box) fails, firing current cannot get to the e-match
either because the firing relay does not close or because no firing current is available.
● No fire means no safety violation.
CAT5 Cable
● If the CAT5 cable were to be damaged and shorted, the system would simply not work as
the current intended to pull in the firing relay would simply travel through the short. No
fire means no safety violation.
Firing Relay
● If the firing relay fails in the ON position the light/buzzer should alert the pad operator of
the failure before he even approaches the pad to hook up the e-match.
Shunt Switch, Lamp/Buzzer
● These are all supplementary safety devices.
● They are intended as added layers of safety to protect and/or warn of failures of other
system components.
● Their correct (or incorrect) function cannot cause an inadvertent firing.

Concluding Remarks
Is this a perfect firing system? No. There is always room for improvement. Lighted switches or
similar features could be added to provide feedback on the health of all components. Support for
firings at multiple launch pads could be included. Support for the fueling of hybrids and/or
liquids could be required. A wireless data link could provide convenient and easy to set up
communications at greater ranges. The list of desired features is going to be heavily situation
dependent and is more likely to be limited by money than good ideas.
The circuit should be designed such that no single equipment failure can result in the inadvertent
firing of the e-match and thus, the rocket motor. Whether or not a particular circuit is applicable
to any given scenario is beside the larger point that in the event of any single failure a firing
system should always fail-safe and never fail in a dangerous manner. No matter how
complicated the system may be, it should be analyzed in depth and the failure of any single
component should never result in the firing of a rocket during an unsafe range condition. Note
that this is the bare minimum requirement; ideally, a firing system can handle multiple failures in
a safe manner.

APPENDIX E: ESRA & TRIPOLI ROCKET ASSOCIATION PARTNERSHIP
Summary
The Experimental Sounding Rocket Association (ESRA) and the Tripoli Rocketry Association
(TRA) are now formally working together to continue to improve overall flight safety and
efficient flight operations at the annual IREC. In addition, student teams flying in the
Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS), Student Research and Design SOLID (SRAD SOLID)
categories, along with both COTS and SRAD hybrid motors will begin flying under TRA
Unified Safety Code. Details of how these impacts competing teams are described below.
Background
TRA and ESRA share common goals to create safe and exciting launch opportunities for the next
generation of Aerospace engineers as they progress from hobby to industry environments. Our
organizations are highly aligned: ESRA provides the educational framework and administration
of the world’s largest international collegiate rocketry event; and TRA provides the safety/flight
operations framework, incredible membership expertise and an amazing insurance program.
Stated simply, we have assembled outstanding partners to build and safely operate the greatest
rocketry competition in history.
The IREC has relied on the TRA Unified Safety Code and membership expertise/guidance to
create a safe launching environment for its event since 2017. IREC’s Range Safety and Launch
Operations teams are filled with a significant number of Senior Level 3 high power rocketry
experts (>30). A growing number of competing teams utilize TRA prefectures for mentorship,
certification flights and test flights of their competition projects.
Benefits:
● Student Team Liability Insurance - In previous years, students were either insured by
their university or through a 3rd party insurance provider. By becoming a TRA student
member and following the TRA Unified Safety Code, the student is insured by TRA’s
insurance program. TRA insurance covers COTS and SRAD solid and hybrid flights.
TRA insurance DOES NOT cover liquid teams or flights.
● Teams flying liquid motors will have to provide their own insurance and submit proof of
insurance to ESRA as specified in paragraph 2.6.6.2 of the IREC Rules and Requirements
document.
● Student teams will have improved access to TRA mentors, certifications, and launch sites
- TRA has a growing list of US and international prefectures with active launch sites.
Student teams are highly recommended to engage with their local TRA prefectures for
mentoring, certification flights and additional launch experience.

Tripoli Flight Requirements for All Solid and Hybrid Categories:
● A TRA-certified Level 3 Flyer of Record shall be required for all solids and hybrids
categories and must be present for launch preparation, pad loading and recovery
activities. There are three options to satisfy the requirement for a Level 3 certified Flyer
of Record.
● Recommended - each team will secure a TRA Level 3 certified Senior mentor who works
closely with the team and is present as the Flyer of Record for the launch preparation, pad
loading and recovery activities. Student teams ARE HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to
subsidize the travel expenses of their Flyer of Record or mentor, both to and from the
event.
● Also recommended - team will have a TRA Level 3 certified student member onsite for
the launch preparation, pad loading and recovery activities. The student L3 member will
be the Flyer of Record and must be onsite with the team for all aspects of launch.
● International Teams should begin their FoR search immediately and utilize social media
platforms, forums and other community outlets to secure a Flyer of Record. ESRA
WILL NOT BE PROVIDING L3 FoR’s.
● TRA membership is required to be on the range or to work on safety-related systems on
the rocket.
● Motors or energetic materials may only be possessed or handled by TRA members with
appropriate high power rocketry certification.
● Student teams flying in all solid and hybrid categories are required to meet all TRA
launch safety requirements to ensure TRA insurance covers their flight.
TRA Student Membership
● TRA Student membership is $20 per year per student. This is a requirement for ANY
student who will be at the launch site.
● A maximum of 5 additional team members who are TRA student members may be on the
pad loading team. These student team members do not have to be HPR certified but must
be TRA student members. All students are highly recommended to secure HPR
certification.
Liquid rockets excluded from this policy change
● TRA brings world-class expertise in the area of solid and hybrid rocket motors.
● The policies and rules for these motors are well established with a robust system of
mentors and specific certification levels.
● Liquid rockets are inherently more complex with dangers and risks that are substantially
different from solid motors. Accordingly, TRA insurance does not cover these rockets,
and teams must provide proof of adequate insurance to ESRA prior to the competition.
● ESRA is committed to continuing to search for viable means to support the establishment
of such an organization to provide similar expertise for liquid rockets.
